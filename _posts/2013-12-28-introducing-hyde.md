title: About me
---

I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow at UCL School of Management. Prior to joining UCL, I earned my PhD in Operations Management and my MPhil in Management Science and Operations at the University of Cambridge as well as a Diplôme d'Ingénieur in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble. 

My research lies at the intersection of innovation and operations management (OM). More specifically, I study how employees or companies react to changes in their organizational or industry landscape and how firms can optimize operational performance given these dynamics. Some applications of the disruptive changes I study are the complex behavioural dynamics behind the adoption of new and risky practices in organizations (e.g., digital innovation), the changes in customer loyalty from new disruptive online sales channels in the hotel industry, and the impact of different incentive schemes in employees' productivity. My PhD research received the INFORMS TIME Best Dissertation Award 2020.

I principally use classic and evolutionary game theory to generate actionable insights and complement these theoretical analyses with data-driven methods such as econometrics and simulations using datasets obtained through industry collaborations.
