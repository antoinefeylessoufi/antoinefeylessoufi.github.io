My name is Antoine Feylessoufi and I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow at UCL School of Management. My research lies at the intersection of innovation and operations management. More specifically, I study how employees
or companies react to changes in their organizational or industry landscape. Some applications I study are the complex behavioural dynamics behind the adoption of new, risky, practices in organizations, the disruption to customer loyalty from new disruptive online channels in the hotel industry, and the productivity impact of different incentive schemes.

I principally use classic and evolutionary game theory to generate actionable insights and complement these theoretical analyses with data-driven methods such as econometrics and simulations using datasets obtained through industry collaborations.
